### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently immersing myself in the world of AI and Machine Learning at Stanford University through their rigorous Artificial Intelligence Professional Program.
- Venturing through the landscapes of tech giants like VMware, Workday, and IBM, and navigating the challenges at two startups, has been a journey of exploration and innovation. Whether it was crafting robust software solutions or pioneering new pathways, each chapter brought unique learnings and challenges.
