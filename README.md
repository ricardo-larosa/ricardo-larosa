### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently immersing myself in the world of AI and Machine Learning at Stanford University through their rigorous Artificial Intelligence Professional Program.
- Venturing through the dynamic landscapes of tech giants like VMware, Workday, and IBM, and navigating the exhilarating challenges at two startups, has been a journey of exploration and innovation. Whether it was crafting robust software solutions or pioneering new pathways, each chapter brought unique learnings and challenges.
- Proudly, I embrace the mantle of a *Generalist.* My journey through various realms has been a stepping stone towards a holistic understanding of the technology.
