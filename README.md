### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently dedicated full time to the Artificial Intelligence Professional Program at Stanford University (OnLine).
- I have worked in big companies like VMware, Workday and IBM. But, also navigated different challenges when working at startups like Consensys.
- My background is diverse but my focus at the moment is on Large Language Models, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Finetuning.
